# Kudy Cats

Kudy Cats is a collection of 10,000 unique and adorable cat NFTs that live on the Internet Computer and Polygon blockchain. Each Kudy Cat has its own personality and style, expressed by its traits such as fur color, eye color, accessories, and background. The traits are randomly generated and assigned to each Kudy Cat, creating a wide variety of combinations and rarities.
The traits are categorized into four levels of rarity: common, rare, epic, and legendary. The rarer the trait, the more valuable the Kudy Cat. The rarity levels are determined by the following probabilities:
1. Common: 50%
2. Rare: 25%
3. Epic: 15%
4. Legendary: 10%

## Some examples of traits are:
1. Fur color: Black, White, Gray, Orange, Brown, etc.
2. Eye color: Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, Purple, etc.
3. Accessory: Hat, Sunglasses, Scarf, Bow, Collar, etc.
4. Background: Forest, Space, Beach, City, Desert, etc.

Kudy Cats are not only cute and collectible, but also have a lively and interactive community. By owning a Kudy Cat, you become a member of the Kudy Club, where you can chat with other Kudy Cat owners, participate in exclusive events and giveaways, and vote on future developments of the project.
